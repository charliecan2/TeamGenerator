## Installation
The user will need to install Node.js from the nodejs.org website. Also, if package.json is not present, it will need to be installed by typing "npm init -y" onto the terminal and inquirer needs to be installed as well by typing "npm install inquirer".
## Usage
To use this generator, the user should open up the terminal and input "node app.js" onto the command line to receive a series of questions. They will be asked to choose what kind of team member they'd like to add onto their page, either a Manager, Engineer, or Intern. Once they're done adding team members, the HTML file will be rendered and be ready to be viewed.
